                    Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, known colloquially as Chinese hibiscus China rose,Hawaiian hibiscus, rose
                    mallow and shoeblackplant, is a species of tropical hibiscus, a flowering plant in the Hibisceae tribe of the
                    family Malvaceae.
                    It is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, but is not known in the wild, so that
                    its native distribution is
                    uncertain.An origin in some part of tropical Asia is likely. It is widely grown as an ornamental
                    plant
                    in the tropics and subtropics.

                    Portulaca umbraticola, also known as the wingpod purslane, is a perennial succulent in the genus of
                    flowering plants Portulaca.
                    Although this species can be easily mistaken for P. oleracea, its foliage tends to be much smaller
                    and wider than
                    that of other species. Flower colours range from yellow, pink, orange and blue and the stems,
                    leaves, flowers and roots are edible. Plants grow up to 25 cm tall.
